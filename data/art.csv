Ring of Water,Ann Gardner,2003,"Glass mosaic, composite, concrete, steel, and terrazzo","Ring of Water ‘floats’ in the rotunda of the Courthouse Building, visible from the exterior of the building through windowpanes framed by large columns. The work surrounds visitors once they step through the main entrance, creating a contrast between the delicate ‘drops of water’ and the massive columns. 56 cables, each strung with 10 pods of ‘water’, hang from an 18’ ring. Each pod is covered with hand-cut and hand-placed blue/gray glass. Ring of Water also includes a terrazzo floor component. The terrazzo circles correspond to the drops of water, as if the hanging drops continued to fall, which again addresses the feeling in the whole space.

“When I designed Ring of Water, I was thinking about how the presence of water suggests a cooling down of the heat, both the literal summer heat in Atlanta and the figurative emotional heat that fills a courtroom…I want people to look at it and feel something, to stand inside or outside and let themselves react to it.” – Ann Gardner

Ann Gardner is a Seattle-based sculptor that largely creates works with mosaic surfaces of hand-cut pieces of glass. She often makes her own tesserae, selecting individual pieces for maximum effect. By using mosaic, her pieces develop interesting textures and complexity.",City of Atlanta,City Court of Atlanta,"150 Garnett St SW, Atlanta, GA 30303",http://www.ocaatlanta.com/public_art/ring-of-water/,33.74744,-84.3931534
Soaring,David Landis,2002,Aluminum,"The garden-like setting of the Fulton County Atrium—marked by the lush greenery of bamboo and the sound of water—is further enhanced by the flock of birds who gracefully circle the space. The suspended aluminum birds, created by artist David Landis, reflect the changing patterns of light. Made of cast aluminum with a wing span of approximately 24 inches, the sculptures are individually suspended from the structure of the Atrium. David Landis holds bachelor and master degrees from Georgia State University, where he currently teaches sculpture. He has completed sculptural commissions for the Atlanta Botanical Garden, ESPN Zone and Kennesaw State University.

"Sardana, Dance of Peace",Manuel Alvarez,1996,Marble,"This sculpture was a gift to the people of Fulton County from the citizens of Barcelona. Inspired in the Sardana, a traditional Catalonian dance, Spanish sculptor Manuel Alvarez created the sculpture working with Georgia marble while in residence in Athens, Georgia. Alvarez’ stay in Georgia and the creation of the sculpture were part of the international arts activities that took place during the 1996 Olympic Games. The five stylized figures represent the five continents and echo the five rings of the Olympic flag. They stand together in a semi-circle, with their hands linked and arms raised, ready for the viewer to complete the traditional circle of this folk dance.",Fulton County,Justice Center Tower,"136 Pryor St SW, Atlanta, GA 30303",http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/sardana-dance-peace,33.7508127,-84.390919
Angles of Reflection,Stuart Keeler,2010,"Glass, vinyl","Angles of Reflection is a contemplative civic memorial, commissioned to honor Judge Rowland W. Barnes, Court Reporter Julie Ann Brandau, and Deputy Sheriff Sergeant Hoyt Teasley, who lost their lives in the Fulton County Courthouse in the service of justice on March 11, 2005. Artist Stuart Keeler conceptually combines several images: a Georgia pine forest, the interior mechanism of a clock, and the circular pattern of seeds in a sunflower’s center, to evoke thoughts about the human condition, transcendence and universal perceptions of time. The three lives are represented metaphorically by the abstracted yellow lines that transpose into golden rays across the pale violet-toned image. “Reflection” is both a scientific and a philosophic term. Scientifically, a beam of light will bounce into new visual directions when it encounters reflective surfaces. Energy is not lost, but transformed, re-directed. As we search for meaning after incomprehensible tragedies, the poem – Think of a Tree from The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying – reminds us of the interconnectedness of all experiences to the ever-evolving whole, Keeler is a sculptor whose work explores the territory between the public realm and the role of the artist in the built environment. He received an M.F.A. from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He is a curator, writer, educator and lecturer. His work has been exhibited internationally, including Yerba Buena Center of the Arts, San Francisco; Propeller, Toronto; Gallery 400, Chicago; and Le Cité Residency, Paris, France. Among his numerous public art commissions include works for the New Indianapolis Airport; the University of Wisconsin-Madison; and the San Diego International Airport. Keeler is Canadian, currently residing in Atlanta. The international architectural glass company, Glas Malerei Peters of Paderborn, Germany, EU, fabricated and installed the artwork. Atlanta artist Michael Reese worked on this project as a technical assistant.",Fulton County,Fulton County Justice Center,"136 Pryor St SW, Atlanta, GA 30303",http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/angles-reflection,33.7508127,-84.390919
Five Points Monument,George Beasley,1996,Bronze and mild steel,"Thirty-six feet in height, the Five Points Monument commemorates the historic intersection where trolley tracks and an artesian water tower once stood, as well as the five streets that intersect to form the heart of Downtown Atlanta. The sculpture is an asymmetric interpretation of the water tower’s traditional girder construction, its structural steel trusses alluding to the trolley tracks now buried below the street. An adjacent smaller sculpture displays texts that focus on the history and destination of each of the five streets forming the intersection: Peachtree, Edgewood, Decatur, Whitehall (South Peachtree), and Marietta. Bronze panels reference the area’s history through text, maps, and other formal data.

Much of artist George Beasley’s work is site-specific installation/performance created to convey to viewers the experience of the “dance” of iron making. The structures, which remain after the initial event has taken place, are visual testimonies of those events. Inspiration for Beasley’s imagery originates from personal and familial links to Celtic history and to the iron foundries of Scotland and the US. He credits these links with his decision to become a sculptor and his adoption of foundry work as a means of artistic expression. George Beasley joined the School of Art and Design faculty at Georgia State University in 1970. Beasley believes effective teaching to be an outgrowth of studio/apprentice practice. He stresses the idea of teaching by example using the production of almost all of his own work in school studios as a vehicle to demonstrate concepts and processes.",City of Atlanta,Five Points Intersection,"Peachtree St NW at Marietta St NW, Atlanta, GA 30303",http://www.ocaatlanta.com/public_art/five-points/,33.7543475,-84.3897684

People of Atlanta,Elizabeth Catlett,1989/90,Bronze,"Artist Elizabeth Catlett wanted this monumental sculpture to reflect the diversity of the people of Atlanta. It features a crowd of busy people passing one another against a cityscape background. Catlett says these people represent “young, old, black, white, Asian, Latin, men, women, children.”

Henry W. Grady,Alexander Doyle,1891,"Bronze, marble, and granite","This memorial bronze sculpture to Atlanta’s famous “New South” newspaper editor was originally dedicated on October 21, 1891 to 25,000 on-lookers. Henry Grady, editor of The Atlanta Constitution, was known as a champion of southern industry and agriculture in the post-Civil War period.  The funds to erect the monument were generated through “public subscriptions” that were received from throughout the United States, an unprecedented tribute considering that Grady had held no office and died as an “unpretentious private citizen.”

Two bronze statues of women are sitting on benches with footstools on both sides of the base. On the foot stool is engraved: “Gorham Manufacturing Co. Founders.” The women are each holding a wreath with the inscription “This hour little needs the loyalty that is loyal to one section and yet holds the other in enduring suspicion and estrangement. Give us the broad and perfect loyalty that loves and trusts Georgia alike with Massachusetts that knows no South, no North, no East, no West; but endures with equal and patriotic love every foot of our soil, every State in our Union.” This inscription  is a quotation taken from an address delivered in Boston a few days before his death in 1889.

The artist Alexander Doyle, a well-regarded sculptor from New York, has depicted Grady in an orator’s stance with two virtues seated beneath him facing north and south. Born in Ohio, Doyle studied in Italy then returned to the United States to become a prominent marble and bronze sculptor of historical figures.",City of Atlanta,,"Marietta St NW at Forsyth St NW, Atlanta, GA 30303",http://www.ocaatlanta.com/public_art/henry-w-grady/,33.7553712,-84.39112569999999

Shango y Eshu-Elegba en la corta de Atlanta,Arturo Lindsay,2003,Painted aluminum and bronze,"Decorative exterior railings and medallions on the Municipal Courthouse feature Yoruba symbols of eyes and lightning bolts, which represent the overseeing of crossroads and justice respectively.

Courthouses are essentially crossroads– public places where issues of social justice are adjudicated, and where fundamental changes dramatically altering the future direction of our lives can occur. In response, I have drawn upon the mythology of the Yoruba, a West African civilization taht has contributed greatly to the cultural traditions of the United States and all of the Americas. Two Yoruba deities known as “orishas” speak to the courthouse’s purpose and daily activities: Orisha Eshu-Elegba, the guardian of crossroads; and Shango, the orisha in charge of social justice. Both are referenced in my designs.”

City Court Gate,Harold Rittenberry,2003,,"This steel gate to the Municipal Court Building depicts a landscape scene with a man sitting under a tree. A pond, birds, the sun, and other figures are cut out of the metal. ”I see things and they’ll speak to me awhile, sometimes I’ll even have a dream about them, and then after awhile it comes out in the drawing,” artist Harold Rittenberry explains, noting in the case of many of the tree drawings, the work is from his memory of trees and woods that are no longer there. ”It’s a protest in my mind about deforestation,” he continues. ”I draw the trees so people can see them and it puts it in their minds how beautiful they are. … I read somewhere a long time ago that when the settlers came here, you could walk across the tops of trees all the way across the country to the California coast,” he says. ”But you can’t do that anymore.”

From Athens, Georgia, the artist did not start making official pieces until later in life. He began experimenting with a blowtorch and works primarily with metal, though he also creates drawings and mixed media works.

Wall Drawing #581,Sol LeWitt,1989,Colored Ink,"This wall painting is located in Atlanta’s City Hall. The artist concentrated in conceptual art, which relies more heavily on the ideas and planning rather than the execution of the work. Regarded as a founder of both Minimal and Conceptual art, in a 1969 article for Studio International, LeWitt wrote, “Two-dimensional works are not seen as objects. The work is a manifestation of an idea. It is an idea and not an object.” Without the traditional support of canvas or paper, wall drawings exist as a set of instructions and can be installed again and again.

Lewitt received a BFA from Syracuse University and was drafted in the Korean War in 1951. During his service he made posters for the Special Services. After his service, he studied at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School in NYC, and worked for Seventeen Magazine, and the MoMA.

Birth of Atlanta,Amy Landesberg,1996,Anodized and painted steel,"“Birth of Atlanta” commemorates the 1837 founding of Atlanta, or Marthasville as it was known at the time. Not far from the monument at the intersection of Central Avenue and Alabama Street, the “Zero Mile Post” marks where City Founders drove a stake into the ground to establish the center point of the circle of the one-mile radius that formed the original city limits. The monument consists of a steel frame with seven pairs of perforated metal “feathers and wings” in flight. Its design makes an abstract reference to the Phoenix, the Greek mythological bird that rose from the ashes. Atlanta’s Civil War history and the burning of Atlanta by General Sherman led Atlanta to take up the symbol of the phoenix. The structure is located above Heritage Row in Underground Atlanta and accompanies a multimedia exhibit on the history of Atlanta managed by the Atlanta History Center.
